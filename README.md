# Hugging-Face-Pipelines-One-Line-Solutions

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the usage of the **Hugging Face `transformers` library** for various natural language processing and computer vision tasks using pre-trained models and pipelines. The notebook covers a range of tasks including Sentiment Analysis, Text Summarization, Question Answering, Named Entity Recognition, Text Generation, Image Classification, Object Detection, Image Segmentation, Translation, Zero-Shot Classification, and Image Captioning. It also includes an assignment section exploring Image Generation with Diffusion Models using the `diffusers` library.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the demonstrations.
*   **transformers:** The core library for using pre-trained models and pipelines.
*   **torch:** A deep learning framework used by `transformers`.
*   **requests:** Used for fetching data from URLs (e.g., images).
*   **PIL (Pillow):** Used for image manipulation.
*   **matplotlib:** Used for displaying images and visualizations.
*   **diffusers:** Used for the image generation assignment.
*   **accelerate:** A library to help run PyTorch models faster.
*   **Google Colab:** The environment where the notebook was developed and executed.

## How to Run
1.  **Open the notebook in Google Colab:** Upload or open the notebook file (.ipynb) in your Google Colab environment.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can use the provided `requirements.txt` file and run `!pip install -r requirements.txt` in a code cell.
3.  **Run all cells:** Execute all the code cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. This will download the necessary models and execute the demonstrations for each pipeline.
